          <h2>Real-time policy debates powered by AI</h2>
          <p>
            StanceStream runs structured debates between distinct AI personas so teams can quickly explore opposing
            perspectives on policy, governance, and social-impact topics. During each session, the platform streams
            messages in real time and visualizes position changes as the discussion evolves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system includes integrated fact-checking to flag claims, evaluate confidence, and capture supporting
            evidence paths. This helps teams move from raw argument generation toward accountable reasoning and faster
            editorial review. Analysts can monitor conversation quality, topic coverage, and consistency while
            maintaining a clear timeline of each debate.
          </p>
          <p>
            For operations and product teams, StanceStream surfaces practical telemetry such as active sessions,
            message throughput, and cache behavior. These live metrics make it easier to diagnose bottlenecks and
            verify production behavior without switching tools. The platform is designed for iterative experimentation,
            from single-thread debates to multi-session scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are evaluating AI-assisted debate workflows, StanceStream provides a unified interface for
            orchestrating debates, observing stance evolution, and reviewing outcomes. Learn more in the
            <a href="/about"> About page</a>, reach the team through
            <a href="/contact"> Contact</a>, and review data handling in the
            <a href="/privacy-policy"> Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teams use this platform to pressure-test assumptions, identify blind spots in policy narratives, and produce
            cleaner briefing outputs. The goal is practical: help people make better decisions with transparent, inspectable
            AI dialogue. StanceStream is not a replacement for human judgment. It is a structured environment for collecting,
            comparing, and auditing machine-generated perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In production deployments, we prioritize observability and resilience. Real-time dashboards expose operational
            health signals and debate-level activity so owners can detect drift quickly. This enables teams to iterate on
            prompts, moderation strategy, and model behavior with direct feedback loops rather than guesswork.
