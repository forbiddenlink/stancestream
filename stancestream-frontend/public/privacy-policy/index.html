      <p>
        StanceStream may collect account metadata, session telemetry, and interaction logs required to operate the platform,
        maintain reliability, and investigate service issues. We use this information to deliver core functionality,
        improve product performance, and support customer troubleshooting.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal data. Information may be processed by infrastructure and analytics providers that support
        hosting, monitoring, and security. These providers operate under contractual controls intended to limit access and
        use to approved service purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is retained only as long as required for operations, support, and legal obligations. Where possible, records
        are deleted or anonymized after retention windows expire. Security controls include encrypted transport, restricted
        access, and monitoring for suspicious events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users may request access, correction, or deletion of personal information by contacting
        <a href="mailto:support@stancestream.com">support@stancestream.com</a>. Requests should include enough detail to
        verify identity and scope. If this policy changes, we will update this page and the published date above.
      </p>
      <p>
        For additional regulatory context, review official guidance from
        <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" rel="noopener noreferrer">California CCPA resources</a> and
        <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu" rel="noopener noreferrer">GDPR references</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        StanceStream applies data minimization practices where possible and encourages customers to avoid submitting
        unnecessary personal data in prompts or support tickets. Access to sensitive operational information is restricted
        to authorized personnel with legitimate support, security, or maintenance responsibilities, and access attempts are
        monitored to help detect anomalous behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a data incident is identified, we follow a documented response process that includes triage, impact assessment,
        containment, and customer communication as required by applicable obligations. This page is intended to provide a
        high-level summary and does not replace contractual terms. For enterprise deployments with custom compliance needs,
        contact our team so retention controls, access scope, and regional requirements can be reviewed before go-live.
      </p>
      <p>
        We periodically review this policy for clarity and operational accuracy so it reflects current product behavior and
        vendor practices. Material updates are posted on this page with revised dates, and teams with active deployments are
        encouraged to review changes during regular governance and security review cycles.
