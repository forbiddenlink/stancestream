      <p>
        For technical support, implementation guidance, or feedback on debate quality, contact
        <a href="mailto:support@stancestream.com">support@stancestream.com</a>. Include your environment details,
        affected route or session, timestamp, and a short description of the expected versus observed behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        For partnerships, demos, or research collaboration, contact
        <a href="mailto:partnerships@stancestream.com">partnerships@stancestream.com</a>. Helpful context includes your
        primary use case, expected workload, and timeline. This helps us route requests to the right team and provide a
        faster response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standard response time for support requests is within two business days. For urgent incidents that block production
        workflows, include "Urgent" in the subject line and attach logs or reproducible steps when available. Clear context
        significantly reduces resolution time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your request concerns data handling, please review our
        <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> first and include any compliance requirements in your message.
        You can also reference
        <a href="https://docs.squirrelscan.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">SquirrelScan documentation</a> and
        <a href="https://vercel.com/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vercel documentation</a> for relevant infrastructure information.
      </p>
      <p>
        When possible, include your organization name, primary decision-makers, and the outcomes you expect from the
        platform. This allows us to tailor onboarding support, suggest suitable integration paths, and identify whether you
        need a short implementation consultation before running production workloads. Clear expectations at intake usually
        produce faster setup, cleaner experiment design, and better long-term operational outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome feedback on usability, documentation gaps, and feature requests. If your team is testing StanceStream
        against another debate platform, share your evaluation criteria and scoring rubric. Comparative context is helpful
        for roadmap planning and helps us prioritize improvements that directly influence practical adoption rather than
        cosmetic changes that add little value.
      </p>
      <p>
        For integration planning, include your preferred deployment model, authentication requirements, and logging
        constraints. This helps us identify whether lightweight onboarding is enough or whether your team would benefit from
        a staged rollout with checkpoints for reliability, moderation quality, and stakeholder review before broader usage.
