      <p>
        StanceStream is an AI-native debate platform created for teams that need fast, structured, and inspectable policy
        discussions. Instead of reviewing disconnected transcripts, users can observe a continuous argument stream between
        distinct personas, each with explicit stances and consistent behavior constraints. The goal is not to create noise.
        The goal is to produce useful disagreement that can be reviewed, scored, and acted on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system combines live message streaming with fact-checking workflows, stance evolution tracking, and operational
        telemetry. This creates a single workspace where product teams, editorial teams, and research teams can test ideas,
        expose weak assumptions, and compare outcomes over time. A debate that looks persuasive at first glance can still be
        examined for evidence quality, consistency, and drift once full context is visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our implementation philosophy is practical and measurable. We prioritize stable APIs, observable runtime behavior,
        and simple controls for iterating on debate settings. Teams can run single-session analysis for focused questions or
        parallel sessions for broader scenario coverage. As usage scales, StanceStream emphasizes reliability through clear
        instrumentation and repeatable workflows.
